The easy possibility of writing letters must have brought wrack and ruin to the souls of the world. Writing letters is actually an intercourse with ghosts, and by no means just the ghost of the addressee but also with one's own ghost, which secretly evolves inside the letter one is writing.
I miss you deeply, unfathomably, senselessly, terribly.
I have spent all my life resisting the desire to end it.
Written kisses don’t reach their destination, rather they are drunk on the way by the ghosts.
I can’t tell you exactly what you are to me, but I can tell you what you are not: you are not a dream, not a shadow, not a figment of my mind.
You once said that you wanted to die with me. I think that would be a terrible idea, for I do not want to die. I want to live - only with you.
You are the knife I turn inside myself; that is love. That, my dear, is love.
I am constantly trying to communicate something incommunicable, to explain something inexplicable, to tell about something I only feel in my bones and which can be experienced only in those bones.
You are not even near me and yet I feel you all around me.
Our world is only a bad mood of God, a bad day of his.
Perhaps there is only one cardinal sin: impatience. Because of impatience we were driven out of Paradise, because of impatience we cannot return.
I am in constant sorrow, but that doesn’t mean that I cannot also be happy.
I am always trying to convey something inexpressible, to explain something unexplainable.
If I didn't have your love, I would not have anything at all.
To write prescriptions is easy, but to come to an understanding with people is hard.
You are my most secret thought, my deepest feeling.
